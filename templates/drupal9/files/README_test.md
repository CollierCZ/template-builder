## About

This template builds Drupal 9 using the "Drupal Recommended" Composer project.  It is pre-configured to use MariaDB and Redis for caching. The Drupal installer will skip asking for database credentials as they are already provided.

Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework.

### Features

- PHP 8.1
- MariaDB 10.4
- Redis 6
- Drush included
- Automatic TLS certificates
- Composer-based build

### Platform.sh

Platform.sh is a unified, secure, enterprise-grade platform for building, running and scaling web applications. Weâ€™re the leader in Fleet Ops: Everything you need to manage your fleet of websites and apps is available from the start. Because infrastructure and workflows are handled from the start, apps just work, so teams can focus on what really matters: making faster changes, collaborating confidently, and scaling responsibly. Whether managing a fleet of ten or ten thousand sites and apps, Platform.sh is the Developer- preferred solution that scales right.

Our key features include:

<details>
<summary><strong>GitOps: Git as the source of truth</strong></summary><br />

Every branch becomes a development environment, and nothing can change without a commit. 

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Batteries included: Managed infrastructure</strong></summary><br />

[Simple abstraction in YAML](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/yaml.html) for [committing and configuring infrastructure](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/structure.html), fully managed patch updates, and 24 [runtimes](https://docs.platform.sh/languages.html) & [services](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html) that can be added with a single line of code.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Instant cloning: Branch, merge, repeat</strong></summary><br />

[Reusable builds](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/build-deploy.html) and automatically inherited production data provide true staging environments - experiment in isolation, test, then destroy or merge.  

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>FleetOps: Fleet management platform</strong></summary><br />

Leverage our public API along with custom tools like [Source Operations](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/source-operations.html) and [Activity Scripts](https://docs.platform.sh/integrations/activity.html) to [manage thousands of applications](https://youtu.be/MILHG9OqhmE) - their dependency updates, fresh content, and upstream code.

## Post-install

Run through the Drupal installer as normal.  You will not be asked for database credentials as those are already provided.

### Local development

This section provides instructions for running the `drupal9` template locally, connected to a live database instance on an active Platform.sh environment.

In all cases for developing with Platform.sh, it's important to develop on an isolated environment - do not connect to data on your production environment when developing locally. Each of the options below assume the following starting point:

```bash
platform get PROJECT_ID
cd project-name
platform environment:branch updates
```

> **Note:**
>
> For many of the steps below, you may need to include the CLI flags `-p PROJECT_ID` and `-e ENVIRONMENT_ID` if you are not in the project directory or if the environment is associated with an existing pull request.

<details>
<summary><strong>Drupal: using ddev</strong></summary><br />

ddev provides an integration with Platform.sh that makes it simple to develop Drupal locally. Check the [providers documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/platform/) for the most up-to-date information. 

In general, the steps are as follows:

1. A configuration file has already been provided at `.ddev/providers/platform.yaml`, so you should not need to run `ddev config`.
1. [Retrieve an API token](https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli/api-tokens.html#get-a-token) for your organization via the management console.
1. Update your dedev global configuration file to use the token you've just retrieved:
    
    ```yaml
    web_environment:
    - PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken`
    ```

1. Run `ddev restart`.
1. Get your project ID with `platform project:info`. If you have not already connected your local repo with the project (as is the case with a source integration, by default), you can run `platform project:list` to locate the project ID, and `platform project:set-remote PROJECT_ID` to configure Platform.sh locally.
1. Update the `.ddev/providers/platform.yaml` file for your current setup:

    ```yaml
    environment_variables:
    project_id: PROJECT_ID
    environment: CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT
    application: drupal
    ```

1. Get the current environment's data with `ddev pull platform`. 
1. When you have finished with your work, run `ddev stop` and `ddev poweroff`.

</details><details>
<summary><strong>Drupal: using Lando</strong></summary><br />

Lando supports PHP applications configured to run on Platform.sh, and pulls from the same registry Platform.sh uses on your remote environments during your local builds through its own [recipe and plugin](https://docs.lando.dev/platformsh/). 

1. When you have finished with your work, run `lando stop` and `lando poweroff`.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Next.js: building the frontend locally</strong></summary><br />

After you have created a new environment, you can connect to a backend Drupal instance and develop the frontend locally with the following steps.

1. `cd client`
1. Update the environment variables for the current environment by running `./get_local_config.sh`. This will pull the generated `.env.local` file for the current environment.

   ```bash
   # This .env file is generated programmatically within the backend Drupal app for each Platform.sh environment
   # and stored within an network storage mount so it can be used locally.

   NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL=https://api.ENVIRONMENT-HASH-PROJECTID.REGION.platformsh.site
   NEXT_IMAGE_DOMAIN=api.ENVIRONMENT-HASH-PROJECTID.REGION.platformsh.site
   DRUPAL_SITE_ID=nextjs_site
   DRUPAL_FRONT_PAGE=/node
   DRUPAL_CLIENT_ID=CONSUMER_CLIENT_ID
   DRUPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=GENERATED_SECRET
   ```

1. Install dependencies: `yarn --frozen-lockfile`.
1. Run the development server: `yarn dev`. Next.js will then run on http://localhost:3000.
