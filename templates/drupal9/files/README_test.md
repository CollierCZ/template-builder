## About

This template builds Drupal 9 using the "Drupal Recommended" Composer project.  It is pre-configured to use MariaDB and Redis for caching. The Drupal installer will skip asking for database credentials as they are already provided.

Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework.

### Features

- PHP 8.1
- MariaDB 10.4
- Redis 6
- Drush included
- Automatic TLS certificates
- Composer-based build

### Platform.sh

Platform.sh is a unified, secure, enterprise-grade platform for building, running and scaling web applications. Weâ€™re the leader in Fleet Ops: Everything you need to manage your fleet of websites and apps is available from the start. Because infrastructure and workflows are handled from the start, apps just work, so teams can focus on what really matters: making faster changes, collaborating confidently, and scaling responsibly. Whether managing a fleet of ten or ten thousand sites and apps, Platform.sh is the Developer- preferred solution that scales right.

Our key features include:

### Post-install

Run through the Drupal installer as normal.  You will not be asked for database credentials as those are already provided.

### Local development

This section provides instructions for running the `drupal9` template locally, connected to a live database instance on an active Platform.sh environment.

In all cases for developing with Platform.sh, it's important to develop on an isolated environment - do not connect to data on your production environment when developing locally. Each of the options below assume the following starting point:

```bash
platform get PROJECT_ID
cd project-name
platform environment:branch updates
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Drupal: using ddev</strong></summary><br />

ddev provides an integration with Platform.sh that makes it simple to develop Drupal locally. Check the [providers documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/platform/) for the most up-to-date information. 

In general, the steps are as follows:

1. A configuration file has already been provided at `.ddev/providers/platform.yaml`, so you should not need to run `ddev config`.
1. [Retrieve an API token](https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli/api-tokens.html#get-a-token) for your organization via the management console.
1. Update your dedev global configuration file to use the token you've just retrieved:
    
    ```yaml
    web_environment:
    - PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken`
    ```

1. Run `ddev restart`.
1. Get your project ID with `platform project:info`. If you have not already connected your local repo with the project (as is the case with a source integration, by default), you can run `platform project:list` to locate the project ID, and `platform project:set-remote PROJECT_ID` to configure Platform.sh locally.
1. Update the `.ddev/providers/platform.yaml` file for your current setup:

    ```yaml
    environment_variables:
    project_id: PROJECT_ID
    environment: CURRENT_ENVIRONMENT
    application: drupal
    ```

1. Get the current environment's data with `ddev pull platform`. 
1. When you have finished with your work, run `ddev stop` and `ddev poweroff`.

</details><details>
<summary><strong>Drupal: using Lando</strong></summary><br />

Lando supports PHP applications configured to run on Platform.sh, and pulls from the same registry Platform.sh uses on your remote environments during your local builds through its own [recipe and plugin](https://docs.lando.dev/platformsh/). 

1. When you have finished with your work, run `lando stop` and `lando poweroff`.

</details>


> **Note:**
>
> For many of the steps above, you may need to include the CLI flags `-p PROJECT_ID` and `-e ENVIRONMENT_ID` if you are not in the project directory or if the environment is associated with an existing pull request.


## Migration

The steps below outline the important steps for migrating your application to Platform.sh - adding the required configuration files and dependencies, for example.
Not every step will be applicable to each person's migration.
These steps actually assume the earliest starting point possible - that there is no code at all locally, and that this template repository will be rebuilt completely from scratch.

- [Getting started](#getting-started-1)
- [Adding and updating files](#adding-and-updating-files)
- [Dependencies](#dependencies)
- [Deploying to Platform.sh](#deploying-to-platformsh)
- [Migrating your data](#migrating-your-data)
- [Next steps](#next-steps)

If you already have code you'd like to migrate, feel free to focus on the steps most relevant to your application and skip the first section.

### Getting started



If you are coming to this README with no local application to start with, begin with this section. Otherwise, move on to [Adding and updating files](#adding-and-updating-files) below.



### Adding and updating files

A small number of files need to be added to or modified in your repository at this point. 
Some of them explicitly configure how the application is built and deployed on Platform.sh, while others simply modify files you may already have locally, in which case you will need to replicate those changes.



|  File | Purpose    |
|:-----------|:--------|
| [`config/sync/.gitkeep`](config/sync/.gitkeep) | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec molestie mauris ut magna laoreet tempor. |
| [`web/sites/default/settings.php`](web/sites/default/settings.php) | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec molestie mauris ut magna laoreet tempor. |
| [`web/sites/default/settings.platformsh.php`](web/sites/default/settings.platformsh.php) | Contains Platform.sh-specific configuration, namely setting up the database connection to the MariaDB service and caching via Redis. |
| [`.environment`](.environment) | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec molestie mauris ut magna laoreet tempor. |
| [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec molestie mauris ut magna laoreet tempor. |
| [`.lando.upstream.yml`](.lando.upstream.yml) | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec molestie mauris ut magna laoreet tempor. |
| [`.platform.app.yaml`](.platform.app.yaml) | This file is required to define the build and deploy process for all application containers on Platform.sh. Within this file, the runtime version, relationships to service containers, and writable mounts are configured. Take a look at the [Application](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app.html) documentation for more details about configuration. Here's a second custom line about the app itself after the shared generic file. |

### Deploying to Platform.sh

Your repository now has all of the code it needs in order to deploy to Platform.sh. 
In order to actually deploy, consult the [Getting started](#getting-started) section of this document, which contains all of the information to either push directly to Platform.sh or to integrate with an external service like GitHub.
When you've finished, come back to this section to learn how to [Migrate your data](#migrating-your-data).

### Migrating your data


If you are moving an existing site to Platform.sh, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data. That means your database and your files.

1. **Importing the database**

    First, obtain a database dump from your current site and save your dump file as `database.sql`. Then, import the database into your Platform.sh site using the CLI:

    ```bash
    platform sql -e main < database.sql
    ```

2. **Importing files**

    You first need to download your files from your current hosting environment. 
    The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your old host's documentation. 

    The `platform mount:upload` command provides a straightforward way to upload an entire directory to your site at once. 
    Under the hood, it uses an SSH tunnel and rsync, so it is as efficient as possible. 
    (There is also a `platform mount:download` command you can use to download files later.) 
    Run the following from your local Git repository root (modifying the `--source` path if needed and setting `BRANCH_NAME` to the branch you are using).

    ```bash
    something
    ```

    Note that `rsync` is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.



### Next steps

With your application now deployed on Platform.sh, things get more interesting. 
Run the command `platform environment:branch new-feature` for your project, or open a trivial pull request off of your current branch. 

The resulting environment is an *exact* copy of production.
It contains identical infrastructure to what's been defined in your configuration files, and even includes data copied from your production environment in its services.
