This template builds a Strapi backend for Platform.sh, which can be used to quickly create an API that can be served by itself or as a Headless CMS data source for another frontend application in the same project. This repository does not include a frontend application, but you can add one of your choice and access Strapi by defining it in a relationship in your frontend's `.platform.app.yaml file.`

Strapi is a Headless CMS framework written in Node.js.
